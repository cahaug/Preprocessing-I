        <h1>Hello there...</h1>
        <p>I am Cale Haug and I just recently started at the Lambda School.  I spent two years at Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State University, studying Chemistry.  During my freshman year, one of my good friends from home passed away from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  I was unable to attend the funeral and mourn properly, and consequently I got very depressed and anhedonic towards my academic duties and personal care.  This was a very difficult time, I always had been a star student, but for the first time, that wasn't me. I wasn't happy with the career-direction my schooling was taking me.  One of my professors told me Laboratory chemists can expect a ten to twenty year drop in normal life expectancy because of the risks they take with chemical exposure everyday.  I stopped going to class, and moved home.  I got a job at the local supermarket, fifteen minutes bike from my parent's house.  That was two and more years ago now.   But the lessons I have learned along the way haven't left me, and I am now a wiser person for my experiences.  Computers and developing websites were always hobbies of mine, and now I intend to make them my career.  Computers and I definitely get along well.</p>

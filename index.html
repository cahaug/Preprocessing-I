        <h1>Hello there...</h1>
        <br />
        <p>I am Cale Haug and I just recently started at the Lambda School.  I spent two years at Barrett, the Honors College at Arizona State University, studying Chemistry.  During my sophomore year, this was a very difficult time-- I wasn't happy with the direction my schooling was taking me.  One of my professors told me Laboratory chemists can expect a ten to twenty year drop in normal life expectancy because of the risks they take with chemical exposure everyday.  I stopped going to class, and moved home.  I got a job at the local supermarket, fifteen minutes bike from my parent's house.  That was two and more years ago now.   But the lessons I have learned along the way haven't left me, and I am now a wiser person for my experiences.  Computers and scripting were always hobbies of mine, and now I intend to make developing and maintaining websites my career.  Computers and I definitely get along well, and that's only one of the reasons I will make a great employee.</p>
